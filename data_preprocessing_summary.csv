"Approx transfer fee: £27m/£55mNow as you can see, there was quit a discrepancy in the reporting of the fee Tottenham paid Real Betis for Giovani Lo Celso.For the entirety of the 2019 summer window, the fee was said to be not too far off Tanguy Ndombele's record £63m. But the transfer initially went through as a loan, and when Spurs triggered the purchase clause, it was for a reported fee of around £27m.Anyway, that's all trivial.

"Approx transfer fee: €120mThe worst transfer of all time? Really?Well it depends how you look at it - we're sure Atletico Madrid can't stop laughing.For Barcelona though, signing Antoine Griezmann has proved to be the worst business they've ever done. And in 90min's eyes, the worst transfer in the history of football.They paid Griezmann's release clause outright in summer 2019, in the peak years of the club being an absolute mess under Josep Maria Bartomeu, with the existing squad of players reportedly against the signing and the management actually having no idea of where to play him.The Frenchman had a generally miserable time of it in his two years at Camp Nou, and was put on a contract so big that it eventually contributed to the club not being able to commit to a new contract for Lionel bloody Messi.Barcelona lost their greatest ever player to PSG because of the financial mess they'd put themselves in (this transfer was a huge factor), and in the end decided to cut their losses on Griezmann too.He went on loan to Atletico Madrid, with an option to buy for €80m less than what they sold him for. Oh, and they beat Barcelona to the league title in 2021 too - with another player they picked up from Camp Nou for chump change in Luis Suarez.","Approx transfer fee 120mThe worst transfer of all time
