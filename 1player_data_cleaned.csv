"40. Alvaro Morata (Real Madrid to Chelsea, 2017)","Approx transfer fee: £60mWhen you're judging centre-forwards, there aren't too many similarities between Diego Costa and Alvaro Morata.So why Chelsea decided to replace the former with the latter is beyond us. Where Costa was fearless, Morata was toothless. Where Costa was a menace to the opposition, Morata was a menace to his own team. Where Costa has highlight reel moments, Morata had gag reel moments.With just 24 goals in 72 appearances for the Blues, the Spaniard kept the club's infamous number nine shirt curse rolling.","approx transfer fee mwhen youre judge centreforwards arent many similarity diego costa alvaro morataso chelsea decide replace former latter beyond us costa fearless morata toothless costa menace opposition morata menace team costa highlight reel moment morata gag reel momentswith just goal appearance blue spaniard keep club infamous numb nine shirt curse roll","alvaro morata real madrid chelsea"
"39. Sebastien Haller (Eintracht Frankfurt to West Ham, 2019)","Approx transfer fee: £45mSandwiched between Sebastien Haller's prolific spells at Eintracht Frankfurt and Ajax was a less than fruitful experience at West Ham.The Hammers' struggles to find a top class striker have long been documented, and they thought their prayers had been answered when they brought in Haller, who at that time had not declared for the Ivory Coast and was on the verge of a France call-up.But the lanky forward failed to consistently find the net in claret and blue and was sold to Ajax 18 months later, since re-establishing himself as a quality striker.","approx transfer fee msandwiched sebastien hallers prolific spell eintracht frankfurt ajax little fruitful experience west hamthe hammer struggle find top class striker long document think prayer answer bring haller time declare ivory coast verge france callupbut lanky forward fail consistently find net claret blue sell ajax month late since reestablish quality striker","sebastien haller eintracht frankfurt west ham"
"38. Diego Costa (Chelsea to Atletico Madrid, 2017)","Approx transfer fee: £45mDiego Costa's first Atletico Madrid spell - the term everyone remembers him for - was undoubtedly a roaring success. We're not here to debate that.His second spell? An underrated disaster.Costa spent the entire summer of 2017 sulking and trying to force a move back to Atleti, but they failed to meet Chelsea's asking price. The Blues omitted him from their squad and found an agreement with the Spanish side days after the summer window closed.When Costa finally arrived back in Madrid, he played a further 81 games for Diego Simeone's charges between long spells on the treatment table, scoring a measly 19 goals.","approx transfer fee mdiego costas first atletico madrid spell term everyone remember undoubtedly roar success debate thathis 2 spell underrate disastercosta spend entire summer sulk try force move back atleti fail meet chelseas ask price blue omit squad find agreement spanish side day summer window closedwhen costa finally arrive back madrid play game diego simeones charge long spell treatment table score measly goal","diego costa chelsea atletico madrid"
"37. Harry Maguire (Leicester to Manchester United, 2019)","Approx transfer fee: £80mMan Utd spent almost an entire summer trying to sign Harry Maguire back in 2019, haggling with Leicester City to drop their £80m asking price. In the end, United wasted weeks and paid the full asking price anyway. They went on to install him as club captain so prematurely that it now looks as if he might lose it, while more clips of Bad Harry Maguire Defending than you can count have circulated on social media with the caption ""What £80m gets u nowadays loooool"".It's hard to not feel sorry for Maguire, really. He's a better player than he's shown but £80m heaped a bunch of pressure on him that he just hasn't been able to handle.","approx transfer fee mman utd spend almost entire summer try sign harry maguire back haggle leicester city drop be ask price end unite waste week pay full ask price anyway go install club captain prematurely now look may lose clip bad harry maguire defend can count circulate social medium caption be get u nowadays looooolits hard feel sorry maguire really hes good player hes show be heap bunch pressure just hasnt able handle","harry maguire leicester manchester unite"
"36. Tiemoue Bakayoko (Monaco to Chelsea (2017)","Approx transfer fee: £40mA star of that famous Monaco team which reached the Champions League semi-finals in 2017, Tiemoue Bakayoko looked a shell of himself following his move to Chelsea.How bad was Bakayoko for the Blues? Well, put it this way - he's played 82 more times for other clubs than he has for Chelsea while being contracted to the Stamford Bridge club. He's a firm member of their 'loan army'.","approx transfer fee ma star famous monaco team reach champion league semifinal tiemoue bakayoko look shell follow move chelseahow bad bakayoko blue good put way hes play time club chelsea contract stamford bridge club hes firm member loan army","tiemoue bakayoko monaco chelsea"
"35. Carlos Tevez (Boca Juniors to Shanghai Shenhua, 2016)","Approx transfer fee: €16m (transfer fee is disputed)In December 2016, Carlos Tevez left his boyhood club Boca Juniors for a second time to join Chinese Super League side Shanghai Shenhua, who reportedly paid him an annual salary of £630,000 a week - supposedly making him the highest paid player in all of world football.Tevez himself disputed those claims telling reporters not to believe the 'legends'.Shenhua were hoping that a superstar like Tevez, who had shone in England, Italy and Argentina, would help them win a first league title since 1995, but the controversial forward had different priorities. Tevez played just 20 times in his one season in China, scoring four (working out at roughly £8m a goal), while he appeared to be unfit and uninterested.The former Man City star later described his time in China as a 'holiday', while Shenhua fans booed him and gave him the nickname 'homesick boy'.As a parting shot on his return to Boca, Tevez claimed Chinese players are 'not as naturally skilled like South American or European players' and added that 'even in 50 years, they still won’t be able to compete.'","approx transfer fee be transfer fee disputedin december carlos tevez leave boyhood club boca junior 2 time join chinese super league side shanghai shenhua reportedly pay annual salary week supposedly make high pay player world footballtevez dispute claim tell reporter believe legendsshenhua hope superstar like tevez shine england italy argentina help win first league title since controversial forward different priority tevez play just time one season china score four work roughly be goal appear unfit uninterestedthe former man city star late describe time china holiday shenhua fan boo give nickname homesick boyas part shoot return boca tevez claim chinese player naturally skill like south american european player add even year still wont able compete","carlos tevez boca junior shanghai shenhua"
"34. Angel Di Maria (Real Madrid to Manchester United, 2014)","Approx transfer fee: £60mThirteen years on from Juan Sebastian Veron, Manchester United once again broke the British transfer record to sign an Argentine midfielder, and Angel Di Maria continued the symmetry by failing to shine at Old Trafford, despite arriving from Real Madrid with a formidable reputation.He started brightly, winning Manchester United's player and goal of the month awards for September, but that soon tailed off and he was named the Telegraph's worst signing of the 2014/15 season (some feat considering Liverpool's haul that summer). He left after just one season for a loss of over £15m. Frustratingly for the Red Devils, he is now an integral player for PSG and Argentina, with that one-year spell in England pretty much the only blip in his career.","approx transfer fee mthirteen year juan sebastian veron manchester unite break british transfer record sign argentine midfielder angel di mare continue symmetry fail shine old trafford despite arrive real madrid formidable reputationhe start brightly win manchester uniteds player goal month award september soon tail name telegraph bad sign season feat consider liverpools haul summer leave just one season loss be frustratingly red devil now integral player psg argentina oneyear spell england pretty much blip career","angel di mare real madrid manchester unite"
"33. Giovani Lo Celso (Betis to Tottenham, 2019)","Approx transfer fee: £27m/£55mNow as you can see, there was quit a discrepancy in the reporting of the fee Tottenham paid Real Betis for Giovani Lo Celso.For the entirety of the 2019 summer window, the fee was said to be not too far off Tanguy Ndombele's record £63m. But the transfer initially went through as a loan, and when Spurs triggered the purchase clause, it was for a reported fee of around £27m.Anyway, that's all trivial. Lo Celso was rubbish for Tottenham and had to block a Twitter account which showcased all of his rubbish moments for the club.","approx transfer fee mmnow can see quit discrepancy report fee tottenham pay real betis giovani lo celsofor entirety summer window fee say far tanguy ndombeles record be transfer initially go loan spur trigger purchase clause report fee around manyway thats trivial lo celso rubbish tottenham block twitter account showcase rubbish moment club","giovani lo celso betis tottenham"
"32. Jack Rodwell (Manchester City to Sunderland, 2014)","Approx transfer fee: £10mNot a patch on many of the other entries on this list in pure financial terms, Rodwell's inclusion is more to do with how he became a living, breathing symbol for Sunderland's excess and mismanagement.The injury-plagued midfielder managed fewer than 45 league starts in over three seasons, but took home £70,000 a week in wages as the Black Cats plummeted from Premier League regulars to League One meme club and teetered on the brink of financial abyss.Local papers the Chronicle and Northern Echo both described the former Evertonian as the worst signing in Sunderland history (no mean feat at all) upon his 2018 exit.","approx transfer fee mnot patch many entry list pure financial term rodwells inclusion become live breathe symbol sunderlands excess mismanagementthe injuryplagued midfielder manage few league start three season take home week wage black cat plummet premier league regular league one meme club teeter brink financial abysslocal paper chronicle northern echo describe former evertonian bad sign sunderland history mean feat upon exit","jack rodwell manchester city sunderland"
"31. Arthur & Miralem Pjanic (Barcelona swap with Juventus, 2020)","Approx transfer fees: £66m & £59.4mPerhaps the most unique entry on the list, here, given we've got two players in one slot.At the height of the coronavirus pandemic, Barcelona and Juventus engaged in what was essentially a swap deal to send an average midfielder the other way.Unsurprisingly, neither of them were any good.","approx transfer fee be mperhaps unique entry list give weve get two player one slotat height coronavirus pandemic barcelona juventus engage essentially swap deal send average midfielder wayunsurprisingly neither good","arthur miralem pjanic barcelona swap juventus"
"30. Juan Sebastian Veron (Lazio to Manchester United, 2001)","Approx transfer fee: £28mManchester United paid a British record fee to sign Juan Sebastian Verón from Lazio in 2001, and it seemed like good business when he hit the ground running with three goals in his first four Premier League outings. But the pace of English football soon took its toll, and Verón's performances took a serious nosedive.""[Veron] is a f*cking great player, and you're all f*cking idiots,"" Sir Alex Ferguson - never one to back down - told the media. However, in 2003 but even SAF conceded defeat and allowed Verón to join Chelsea for half what United had paid Lazio two years before.The injury-riddled Argentine was no better at Stamford Bridge, making just seven Premier League appearances before returning to Italy.","approx transfer fee mmanchester unite pay british record fee sign juan sebastian ver<c3><b3>n lazio seem like good business hit grind run three goal first four premier league outing pace english football soon take toll ver<c3><b3>ns performance take serious nosediveveron fcking great player youre fcking idiot sir alex ferguson never one back tell medium however even saf concede defeat allow ver<c3><b3>n join chelsea half unite pay lazio two year beforethe injuryriddled argentine good stamford bridge make just seven premier league appearance return italy","juan sebastian veron lazio manchester unite"
"29. Dmytro Chygrynskiy (Shakhtar Donetsk to Barcelona, 2009)","Approx transfer fee: €25mRemember Dmytro Chygrynskiy? What do you mean, no??The biblical-looking Ukrainian defender kept Barcelona's formidable attack at bay for 115 minutes in the 2009 UEFA Super Cup, convincing Pep Guardiola to spend big to sign him from Shakhtar Donetsk as competition for Gerard Pique and Carles Puyol.Chygrynskiy played just 14 matches in all competitions for Barcelona, before returning to Shakhtar Donetsk at the end of the season.His name remains a bizarre footnote in an illustrious period of Barcelona's history.","approx transfer fee mremember dmytro chygrynskiy mean nothe biblicallooking ukrainian defender keep barcelonas formidable attack bay minute uefa super cup convince pep guardiola spend big sign shakhtar donetsk competition gerard pique carles puyolchygrynskiy play just match competition barcelona return shakhtar donetsk end seasonhis name remain bizarre footnote illustrious period barcelonas history","dmytro chygrynskiy shakhtar donetsk barcelona"
"28. Kaka (AC Milan to Real Madrid, 2009)","Approx transfer fee: €68.5mIt seems implausible that Kaka could ever appear on a worst list of anything. The boyish Brazilian was one of the finest players of his generation, a stylish attacking midfielder whose poise was matched by his power. He was the last player to win the Ballon d'Or before Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo's decade of dominance.Yet, despite becoming the world's most expensive footballer when he joined Real Madrid in 2009, it soon became evident that Kaka's best years were behind him. Injuries marred his first two years at the Bernabeu, during which time Mesut Ozil took his place in the team. Kaka was sold back to Milan in 2013 on what was essentially a free deal.It remains one of football's biggest ever transfer losses.","approx transfer fee mit seem implausible kaka ever appear bad list anything boyish brazilian one fine player generation stylish attack midfielder whose poise match power last player win ballon dor lionel messi cristiano ronaldos decade dominanceyet despite become world expensive footballer join real madrid soon become evident kakas good year behind injury mar first two year bernabeu time mesut ozil take place team kaka sell back milan essentially free dealit remain one football big ever transfer loss","kaka ac milan real madrid"
"27. Ricardo Quaresma (Porto to Inter, 2008)","Approx transfer fee: €19mRicardo Quaresma came through the ranks at Sporting CP around the same time as Cristiano Ronaldo, but their careers would take quite different paths. Quaresma joined Barcelona in 2003 but returned to Portugal with Porto just one year later, where he rediscovered his form in his home country, winning a move to Italy in 2008.But Quaresma's ability and attitude both came under the microscope at Inter, with Inter boss Jose Mourinho - famously not a great lover of temperamental forwards - questioning his team ethic. He was 'awarded' the infamous Bidone d'Oro (Golden Bin) award for worst Serie A player at the end of his debut season, and joined Besiktas after two unhappy years which yielded just one Inter goal.","approx transfer fee mricardo quaresma come rank sport cp around time cristiano ronaldo career take quite different path quaresma join barcelona return portugal porto just one year late rediscover form home country win move italy quaresmas ability attitude come microscope inter inter boss jose mourinho famously great lover temperamental forward question team ethic award infamous bidone doro golden bin award bad serie player end debut season join besiktas two unhappy year yield just one inter goal","ricardo quaresma porto inter"
"26. Eliaquim Mangala (Valencia to Manchester City, 2014)","Approx transfer fee: £42mWhat a summer 2014 was!A mind-boggling amount of money, Mangala could never live up to his price tag at the Etihad, but he might at least have given it a go...On his second league outing he scored an own goal and conceded a penalty to throw away a 2–0 lead against Hull, while a couple of months later he suffered his first sending off.Things never really recovered from there for one of the Premier League's most expensive ever defenders, who was replaced by Nicolas Otamendi and left on a free in 2019 after a couple of loan spells.","approx transfer fee mwhat summer wasa mindboggling amount money mangala never live price tag etihad may less give goon 2 league outing score goal concede penalty throw away lead hull couple month late suffer first send offthings never really recover one premier league expensive ever defender replace nicolas otamendi leave free couple loan spell","eliaquim mangala valencia manchester city"
"25. Leonardo Bonucci (Juventus to Milan, 2017)","Approx transfer fee: €42mIn an eye-catching summer of business that included the arrivals of Hakan Çalhanoğlu and Lucas Biglia, the signing of Bonucci from rivals Juve seemed like the most impressive of all.One of the world's best defenders was looking for a new challenge, after years of domestic (if not European) success in Turin.Things did not go to plan, and Milan - for all their spending - wound up finishing sixth, while Bonucci, who had been made Rossneri captain, spent the year with an expression that read 'I've made a huge mistake.' Back he went to Juve after just one year for the princely sum of one Mattia Caldara.","approx transfer fee min eyecatching summer business include arrival hakan <c3><a7>alhano<c4><9f>lu lucas biglia sign bonucci rival juve seem like impressive allone world good defender look new challenge year domestic european success turinthings go plan milan spend wind finish 6 bonucci make rossneri captain spend year expression read ive make huge mistake back go juve just one year princely sum one mattia caldara","leonardo bonucci juventus milan"
"24. Tanguy Ndombele (Lyon to Tottenham, 2019)","Approx transfer fee: £63mTanguy Ndombele was signed by Tottenham in hope of being the long-term successor to Mousa Dembele - a dynamic box-to-box midfielder who could run rings around opponents.While the Frenchman has had enough good moments in lilywhite to make a decent YouTube compilation, he's largely failed to adapt to the English game, with his fitness and work rate particularly unimpressive.He still has plenty of talent, but he'll have to put the hard yards in if he's ever going to fulfil his potential.","approx transfer fee mtanguy ndombele sign tottenham hope longterm successor mousa dembele dynamic boxtobox midfielder run ring around opponentswhile frenchman enough good moment lilywhite make decent youtube compilation hes largely fail adapt english game fitness work rate particularly unimpressivehe still plenty talent hell put hard yard hes ever go fulfil potential","tanguy ndombele lyon tottenham"
"23. Nicolas Pepe (Lille to Arsenal, 2019)","Approx transfer fee: £72mSocial media became unbearable the day Arsenal unveiled Nicolas Pepe as their new record signing. It was even worse a few weeks later when he dribbled past Virgil van Dijk and fooled people into thinking he was going to be a superstar.In the red of Arsenal, Pepe has looked a lot like an annoying five-a-side teammate, endlessly dribbling down dead ends, never knowing when to release the ball and barely contributing anything tangible to games.","approx transfer fee msocial medium become unbearable day arsenal unveil nicolas pepe new record sign even bad week late dribble past virgil van dijk fool people think go superstarin red arsenal pepe look lot like annoy fiveaside teammate endlessly dribble dead end never know release ball barely contribute anything tangible game","nicolas pepe lille arsenal"
"22. Mario Balotelli (AC Milan to Liverpool, 2014)","Approx transfer fee: £16mMuch like Rodwell, the wider symbolism here is more significant than the actual transfer fee.Mario Balotelli, once touted as one of the continent's top young talents, was signed by Liverpool to replace Barcelona-bound Luis Suarez, the man who had scored 31 times in 33 Premier League games in the 2013/14 Premier League season and almost dragged his teammates kicking and screaming to the title.Balotelli scored exactly one Premier League goal for the Reds as Brendan Rodgers' side collapsed into mediocrity.He was let go for free, after a loan back to Milan.","approx transfer fee mmuch like rodwell wide symbolism significant actual transfer feemario balotelli tout one continent top young talent sign liverpool replace barcelonabound luis suarez man score time premier league game premier league season almost drag teammate kick scream titlebalotelli score exactly one premier league goal red brendan rodgers side collapse mediocrityhe let go free loan back milan","mario balotelli ac milan liverpool"

"20. Fernando Torres (Liverpool to Chelsea, 2011)","Approx transfer fee: £50mOn the face of it, this looked like an incredible piece of business for Chelsea, stealing one of the Premier League's most lethal strikers from rivals Liverpool on deadline day, but for whatever reason Torres' ill-fated spell with the Blues never reached the heights he had achieved at Anfield.In fairness, Torres did score 45 times for Chelsea, including the goal which confirmed their place in the 2012 Champions League final, but he never scored more than eight goals in a Premier League season at Stamford Bridge and was a shadow of the world class front man Liverpool and Spain had gotten in the years previously.","approx transfer fee mon face look like incredible piece business chelsea steal one premier league lethal striker rival liverpool deadline day whatever reason torres illfated spell blue never reach height achieve anfieldin fairness torres score time chelsea include goal confirm place champion league final never score eight goal premier league season stamford bridge shadow world class front man liverpool spain get year previously","fernando torres liverpool chelsea"
"19. Adrian Mutu (Parma to Chelsea, 2003)","Approx transfer fee: £16mWith just six goals in 27 Premier League appearances for Chelsea (four of which came in his first three games), Mutu never delivered on the potential he had shown in Serie A with Verona and Parma, while he was one of many to endure a difficult relationship with Jose Mourinho. But let's be honest, Mutu isn't on this list because he was a bad footballer.In September 2004, Mutu was banned from football for seven months after testing positive for cocaine. Chelsea sought compensation for a breach of contract and a long-winded legal battle ensued. In 2018, the European Court of Human Rights rejected Mutu's appeal against CAS 2015 ruling that meant he owed Chelsea €17m in damages.","approx transfer fee mwith just six goal premier league appearance chelsea four come first three game mutu never deliver potential show serie verona parma one many endure difficult relationship jose mourinho let honest mutu isnt list bad footballerin september mutu ban football seven month test positive cocaine chelsea seek compensation breach contract longwinded legal battle ensue european court human right reject mutus appeal cas rule mean owe chelsea be damage","adrian mutu parma chelsea"

In August 2017, he joined Stoke City on loan. His annus horribilis started with a €25m move to Paris Saint-Germain, and from there he was soon sent on loan to Las Palmas after six months of injuries and poor form.In total, Jese played just 18 times for PSG across four seasons before having his contract cancelled amid COVID lockdown breach scandal in December 2020.","approx transfer fee min may jes<c3><a9> rodriguez bench real madrid champion league final august join stoke city loan annus horribilis start be move paris saintgermain soon send loan las palmas six month injury poor formin total jese play just time psg across four season contract cancel amid covid lockdown breach scandal december","jese rodriguez real madrid paris saintgermain"
"16. Jackson Martinez (Atletico Madrid to Guangzhou Evergrande, 2016)","Approx transfer fee: €42mIn reality, Martinez could've made the list for two separate deals.Despite having seen the once prolific Colombian flounder at Atletico Madrid (where he scored just three times in 22 appearances) Guangzhou Evergrande decided this was the striker for them to go big on.At the height of the Chinese Super League's new spending power, Guangzhou paid €42m to bring Martinez to Asia - amazingly some €7m more than Atleti paid the year earlier before he flopped. Diego Simeone must've thought it was some sort of prank.Martinez, who was famously on a €12m deal, suffered horrendous luck with ankle injuries in China and made just 16 appearances in three seasons before his contract was cancelled.","approx transfer fee min reality martinez couldve make list two separate dealsdespite see prolific colombian flounder atletico madrid score just three time appearance guangzhou evergrande decide striker go big onat height chinese super league new spend power guangzhou pay be bring martinez asia amazingly be atleti pay year early flop diego simeone mustve think sort prankmartinez famously be deal suffer horrendous luck ankle injury china make just appearance three season contract cancel","jackson martinez atletico madrid guangzhou evergrande"

Jonathan Woodgate (Newcastle United to Real Madrid, 2004)","Approx transfer fee: £13.5mSome players have their careers disrupted by injury; Jonathan Woodgate's career was one long injury disrupted by occasional periods of fitness. To the surprise of absolutely nobody, Woodgate got injured at the end of the 2003/04 season, but what was surprising was that this did not stop Real Madrid from signing him.Numerous injury complications meant that Woodgate didn't actually make his Real Madrid debut for over a year, but boy was it worth the wait. The former Newcastle star scored an own goal after 26 minutes and was sent off for a second bookable offence midway through the second half. After just nine La Liga appearances, Woodgate returned to England, having been named the worst signing of the 21st century in a Marca poll.","approx transfer fee msome player career disrupt injury jonathan woodgates career one long injury disrupt occasional period fitness surprise absolutely nobody woodgate get injure end season surprise stop real madrid sign himnumerous injury complication mean woodgate didnt actually make real madrid debut year boy worth wait former newcastle star score goal minute send 2 bookable offence midway 2 half just nine la liga appearance woodgate return england name bad sign st century marca poll","jonathan woodgate newcastle unite real madrid"

In his first season, Jovic struggled with injuries and was given precious little chance to impress, scoring just twice in 27 outings.Then came the pandemic and a lockdown breach scandal that even involved the Serbian Prime Minister.

He was named Best Midfielder in Europe by UEFA two years on the trot, and when Lazio signed him in 2001, they made him the sixth most expensive player of all time with a deal worth an incredible sounding eight billion pesetas.In today's money, the deal would've been worth close to the €100m mark.However, after betting the farm on their man, Mendieta, who had been a regular goalscorer towards the end of his time at the Mestalla, failed to hit the target once in 31 appearances for the Biancocelesti, who offloaded him to Barcelona after just one season.","approx transfer fee be time valencia consider one good team europe gaizka mendieta beat heart name good midfielder europe uefa two year trot lazio sign make 6 expensive player time deal worth incredible sound eight billion pesetasin today money deal wouldve worth close be markhowever bet farm man mendieta regular goalscorer towards end time mestalla fail hit target appearance biancocelesti offload barcelona just one season","gaizka mendieta valencia lazio"

Zlatan Ibrahimovic (Inter to Barcelona, 2010)","Approx transfer fee: £59m + Samuel Eto'oZlatan Ibrahimovic has scored goals everywhere he has played, and Barcelona was no different - in his defence, he found the net 21 times in his only full season at Camp Nou. But the problems were all off the pitch. Firstly, no-one seemed to understand why Barcelona spent big and traded Samuel Eto'o for the big Swede and his big ego.While Eto'o went on to win the treble at Inter, Zlatan was (allegedly) threatening to physically assault Pep Guardiola.Forced to play in the shadow of Lionel Messi, Ibrahimovic grew frustrated and aggro. As a result, he was sent back to Italy at the end of the season.","approx transfer fee be samuel etoozlatan ibrahimovic score goal everywhere play barcelona different defence find net time full season camp nou problem pitch firstly noone seem understand barcelona spend big trade samuel etoo big swede big egowhile etoo go win treble inter zlatan allegedly threaten physically assault pep guardiolaforced play shadow lionel messi ibrahimovic grow frustrate aggro result send back italy end season","zlatan ibrahimovic inter barcelona"

A prolific goalscorer in Italy, he scored 173 goals during his first spell with AC Milan, surpassing the 25-goal mark in six of his eight seasons at San Siro, and won the Ballon d'Or in 2004.Signing the Ukrainian became a pet project for Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, who got his man in 2006 - regardless of what Mourinho actually wanted.Alas, Shevchenko's ageing limbs and the pace of English football did not agree with one another.

Danny Drinkwater (Leicester to Chelsea, 2017)","Approx transfer fee: £35mContinuing the run of Chelsea flops, it is Drinkwater, whose £35m move to Stamford Bridge in 2017 raised eyebrows even before a ball was kicked in anger.The former Premier League winner with Leicester made just 12 league appearances and found himself rather unloved by Antonio Conte and latterly Maurizio Sarri.Amid a series of uninspiring loan spells, Drinkwater's on-field nadir came with a brawl-sparking red card in a PL2 game against Spurs in 2020.Off the field, unsavoury incidents including a drink driving charge and a nightclub fight that left him with ligament damage have coloured a once respected career.He joined Reading on loan in summer 2021.","approx transfer fee mcontinuing run chelsea flop drinkwater whose be move stamford bridge raise eyebrow even ball kick angerthe former premier league winner leicester make just league appearance find rather unloved antonio conte latterly maurizio sarriamid series uninspiring loan spell drinkwaters onfield nadir come brawlsparking red card pl game spur field unsavoury incident include drink drive charge nightclub fight leave ligament damage colour respect careerhe join read loan summer","danny drinkwater leicester chelsea"
"8. Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal to Manchester United, 2018)","Approx transfer fee: Swap with Henrikh MkhitaryanHow can a deal that involved no real transfer fee be so bad, you ask? Well...Alexis Sanchez arrived at Manchester United as perhaps the Premier League's biggest talent, ripped from rivals Arsenal with his contract running down. To add a cherry on top, United even beat off competition from Man City to land the Chilean. In order to convince Sanchez to pick red over blue, United stumped up a contract worth depressingly close to £500k a week before plonking their new forward in front of the piano for what would become one of the most infamous announcement videos of all time.Sanchez's contract became an albatross around his neck as his form dived off a cliff.In total, he scored three Premier League goals in 32 outings and generally stunk Old Trafford up, before being loaned out to Inter where he now resides permanently, having had his whopper of a United deal paid off early.","approx transfer fee swap henrikh mkhitaryanhow can deal involve real transfer fee bad ask wellalexis sanchez arrive manchester unite perhaps premier league big talent rip rival arsenal contract run add cherry top unite even beat competition man city land chilean order convince sanchez pick red blue unite stump contract worth depressingly close k week plonk new forward front piano become one infamous announcement video timesanchezs contract become albatross around neck form dive cliffin total score three premier league goal outing generally stink old trafford loan inter now reside permanently whopper unite deal pay early","alexis sanchez arsenal manchester unite"
"7. Kepa Arrizabalaga (Athletic Club to Chelsea, 2018)","Approx transfer fee: £72mSix months after Real Madrid almost landed the promising Basque stopper for around £20m, Chelsea - in the wake of Thibaut Courtois' departure - panicked and paid the full release clause for 23-year-old Kepa Arrizabalaga.A world-record fee for a goalkeeper, Chelsea's purchase raised eyebrows which weren't lowered by Kepa's unconvincing displays.Though he impressed in the Blues' Europa League run and triumph, his league form never matched the price tag. Meanwhile, stats about just how bad his save percentage was continued to do the rounds on social media.Then after that League Cup final incident with Maurizio Sarri, where he refused to be substituted, things took a dramatic turn for the worse.He goes into the 2021/22 season as probably the Premier League's most expensive bench warmer, having been usurped by new keeper Edouard Mendy.","approx transfer fee msix month real madrid almost land promise basque stopper around be chelsea wake thibaut courtois departure panic pay full release clause yearold kepa arrizabalagaa worldrecord fee goalkeeper chelseas purchase raise eyebrow werent lower kepas unconvincing displaysthough impress blue europa league run triumph league form never match price tag meanwhile stats just bad save percentage continue round social mediathen league cup final incident maurizio sarri refuse substitute thing take dramatic turn worsehe go season probably premier league expensive bench warm usurp new keeper edouard mendy","kepa arrizabalaga athletic club chelsea"
"6. Paul Pogba (Juventus to Man Utd, 2016)","Approx transfer fee: £89m Now that Paul Pogba has left Manchester United, there can't be any doubt - his £89m move to Old Trafford in 2016 was absolutely rotten.Forever a case of unfulfilled potential, Pogba only managed to show his best form for very brief spells in the six years of his second stint in the north west...what we saw more of was unhappiness, poor effort levels and a continued narrative of ""I want to leave"".And leave he did in 2022.Pogba is a United academy product that left the club for free once, joined Juventus, rejoined United for a then world record fee of £89m, and then left for Juventus again...for free.If you want a summary of just how bad Man Utd are at transfers, look no further.","approx transfer fee be now paul pogba leave manchester unite cant doubt be move old trafford absolutely rottenforever case unfulfilled potential pogba manage show good form brief spell six year 2 stint north westwhat see unhappiness poor effort level continue narrative want leaveand leave pogba unite academy product leave club free join juventus rejoin unite world record fee be leave juventus againfor freeif want summary just bad man utd transfer look","paul pogba juventus man utd"

Ousmane Dembele (Borussia Dortmund to Barcelona, 2017)","Approx transfer fee: €105m (rising to €145m with add-ons)Dembele has the unwanted distinction of perhaps being football's first 100m flop.The French winger shone in a breakthrough season at Dortmund, which convinced Barcelona to go big with their new Neymar money burning a hole in their pockets.Though there have been flashes of brilliance here and there, injuries and reports of discipline problems marred Dembele's first four seasons at Camp Nou.In total he missed a ridiculous 85 games between 2017 and 2021 through injury, while reports that he skipped training after staying up all night to play video games did his reputation no favours.Now as Barça teeter on the brink of financial chaos, Dembele's huge-money signing looks like a prime example of the dangerous spending under former president Josep Maria Bartomeu.","approx transfer fee be rise be addonsdembele unwanted distinction perhaps football first be flopthe french winger shine breakthrough season dortmund convince barcelona go big new neymar money burn hole pocketsthough flash brilliance injury report discipline problem mar dembeles first four season camp nouin total miss ridiculous game injury report skip train stay night play video game reputation favoursnow bar<c3><a7>a teeter brink financial chaos dembeles hugemoney sign look like prime example dangerous spend former president josep mare bartomeu","ousmane dembele borussia dortmund barcelona"
"4. Romelu Lukaku (Inter to Chelsea, 2021)","Approx transfer fee: £97.5mRomelu Lukaku's glorious return to Chelsea was unfinished business.He'd been sold by the Blues, the club he'd loved since he was young, early on in his career, and after an underwhelming spell at Man Utd had found his groove at Inter under Antonio Conte.Lukaku scored a ton as Inter won the league, and when Chelsea paid just shy of £100m for him in 2021 he was tipped to do the same for them.Instead, he scored a few goals against inferior opposition, did an interview with Sky Italia about how much he missed Inter & moaned about not being played to his strengths at Chelsea, before being frozen out of the team by Thomas Tuchel.Chelsea, desperate to part ways, have now shifted Rom back to Inter for a loan fee around a tenth of the fee agreed with Inter a year prior. Awful stuff.","approx transfer fee mromelu lukakus glorious return chelsea unfinished businesshed sell blue club hed love since young early career underwhelm spell man utd find groove inter antonio contelukaku score ton inter win league chelsea pay just shy be tip theminstead score goal inferior opposition interview sky italia much miss inter moan play strength chelsea freeze team thomas tuchelchelsea desperate part way now shift rom back inter loan fee around 10 fee agree inter year prior awful stuff","romelu lukaku inter chelsea"
"3. Philippe Coutinho (Liverpool to Barcelona, 2018)","Approx transfer fee: £105m (rising to £142m with add-ons)Incredibly, Ousmane Dembele's transfer is not Barcelona's worst of all time... though nor is Philippe Coutinho's to be fair.The Brazilian was still awful, though. He not only failed to perform consistently in a Barca shirt, but played an active role in knocking them out of the 2019/20 Champions League.Much like with Dembele, Barcelona overpaid to get their man following Neymar's traumatic departure, but struggled to come to terms with the fact that Coutinho simply was not Neymar.Despite some reasonable showing in his first two seasons, it became clear that Barca didn't really have a role for Coutinho and loaned him out to Bayern Munich...and we all know what happened there.Coutinho went back to Catalonia and remained virtually unsellable due to his wages - that was until Aston Villa took him back to the Premier League on loan in January 2022. The Villans made the move permanent in the summer, allowing the lovey-dovey Steven Gerrard reunion to continue.","approx transfer fee be rise be addonsincredibly ousmane dembeles transfer barcelonas bad time though philippe coutinhos fairthe brazilian still awful though fail perform consistently barca shirt play active role knock champion leaguemuch like dembele barcelona overpay get man follow neymars traumatic departure struggle come term fact coutinho simply neymardespite reasonable show first two season become clear barca didnt really role coutinho loan bayern munichand know happen therecoutinho go back catalonia remain virtually unsellable due wage aston villa take back premier league loan january villans make move permanent summer allow loveydovey steven gerrard reunion continue","philippe coutinho liverpool barcelona"

He had a total of five for Los Blancos by the start of 2021/22, and literally more injuries.The now 31-year-old (who is reportedly on £400,000 a week) did not win fans over by arriving for pre-season seven kilos overweight and later laughing with Chelsea stars as they knocked Real Madrid out of the Champions League in 2021.He's been so disastrous that he may end up making perma-angry El Chiringuito pundits prefer Gareth Bale.","approx transfer fee be rise be addonssigned marquee replacement cristiano ronaldo santiago bernabeu really strange thing madrid simple wait year get hazard freethey didnt though essentially pay north be one goal score entirety season total five los blancos start literally injuriesthe now yearold reportedly week win fan arrive preseason seven kilo overweight late laugh chelsea star knock real madrid champion league hes disastrous may end make permaangry el chiringuito pundit prefer gareth bale","eden hazard chelsea real madrid"
"1. Antoine Griezmann (Atletico Madrid to Barcelona, 2021)","Approx transfer fee: €120mThe worst transfer of all time? Really?Well it depends how you look at it - we're sure Atletico Madrid can't stop laughing.For Barcelona though, signing Antoine Griezmann has proved to be the worst business they've ever done. And in 90min's eyes, the worst transfer in the history of football.They paid Griezmann's release clause outright in summer 2019, in the peak years of the club being an absolute mess under Josep Maria Bartomeu, with the existing squad of players reportedly against the signing and the management actually having no idea of where to play him.The Frenchman had a generally miserable time of it in his two years at Camp Nou, and was put on a contract so big that it eventually contributed to the club not being able to commit to a new contract for Lionel bloody Messi.Barcelona lost their greatest ever player to PSG because of the financial mess they'd put themselves in (this transfer was a huge factor), and in the end decided to cut their losses on Griezmann too.He went on loan to Atletico Madrid, with an option to buy for €80m less than what they sold him for. Oh, and they beat Barcelona to the league title in 2021 too - with another player they picked up from Camp Nou for chump change in Luis Suarez.","approx transfer fee mthe bad transfer time reallywell depend look sure atletico madrid cant stop laughingfor barcelona though sign antoine griezmann prove bad business theyve ever do min eye bad transfer history footballthey pay griezmanns release clause outright summer peak year club absolute mess josep mare bartomeu exist squad player reportedly sign management actually idea play himthe frenchman generally miserable time two year camp nou put contract big eventually contribute club able commit new contract lionel bloody messibarcelona lose great ever player psg financial mess theyd put transfer huge factor end decide cut loss griezmann toohe go loan atletico madrid option buy be little sell oh beat barcelona league title another player pick camp nou chump change luis suarez","antoine griezmann atletico madrid barcelona"
